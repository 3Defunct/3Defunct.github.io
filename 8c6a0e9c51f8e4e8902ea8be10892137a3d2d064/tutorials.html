<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>To change a viewport camera, use the associated letter with viewport selected, e.g. T for Top, P for Perspective.<br>
Another way to change camera type is to click the current view type, which shows a list of other options.<br>
Viewport layout tab in the bottom left.<br>
Right click the grey area between viewports to get reset layout option.<br>
Alt+W to maximise viewport.<br>
Shading viewport option next to current viewtype option, can use this to get a higher quality version/wireframe etc.<br>
F3 to uqikcly switch between wireframe and shading view. F4 to have both views at once.<br>
Middle mouse button to pan the view.<br>
Alt + Middle Mouse Button to orbit view.<br>
Scroll wheel to zoom.<br>
Ctrl + Alt + Middle Mouse Button + Mouse up/down for a slower zoom. <br>
Z centers object in viewport, similar to Maya's F.<br>
More camera navigation options in the bottom right.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Create objects from the right side menu.<br>
Objects have different orintation dependant on the viewport you create them in.<br>
Use autogrid option (above the objects in the object type menu) to orient your new object along the axis of a pre-existing one.<br>
On the modify object menu (next to the create object on the right), you can click the color box next to the object name and change the wireframe color.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Right click value spinners to set value to 0/lowest, good for zeoing out location.<br>
Saving is standard, no different file types like in maya.<br>
X,Y,Z coords of object at the bottom of the screen.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Select object button is square with the mouse over it in the top bar menu on the left.<br>
Hold Ctrl to select multiple objects at a time, and Alt to deselect.<br>
Window/Crossing (grey dashed box with blue cube) button on the topbar can be used to change slection mode, between all objects in rectangle and all objects entirely in recetangle.<br>
Selection sets (Middle of top bar) are a useful way of grouping objects just for selection.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Mostly the same as Maya.<br>
Angle snap button is corner with angle (lol) with magnet, right click to change angle amount. Shortcut is A.<br>
Hold down left click on scale tool button and select bottom option to get a squash and stretch scale.<br>
Bottom of the screen XYZ values change depending on what tool is in use.<br>
Recitile icon next to XYZ values can be clicked to add values to movement/scale etc without having to do the math yourself.<br>
Align tool is two bar graph looking thingy to the right of the create selection set object in the top toolbar. Works by selecting object to move then align to object.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Cooridnate system option is to the right of the scale tool, and determines which way the X,Y,Z axis face. Boxes at the bottom will always use world in absolute mode. Local is based on object orintation, useful for rotation.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Hold Shift and move/rotate/scale and object to clone it, and a dialogue box appears.<br>
In dialogue can specify multiple duplicates spaces evenly apart<br>
Different copy types: Copy is a copy, completely different object. Instance means they're the same object, changing one effects the other in modifiers, saves having to do minute changes multiple times.
