<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Viewport layout tab in the bottom left.<br>
Create object with the right side menu plus icon.<br>
Very similar to Maya overall.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>To change a viewport camera, use the associated letter with viewport selected, e.g. T for Top, P for Perspective.<br>
Another way to change camera type is to click the current view type, which shows a list of other options.<br>
Viewport layout tab in the bottom left.<br>
Right click the grey area between viewports to get reset layout option.<br>
Alt+W to maximise viewport.<br>
Shading viewport option next to current viewtype option, can use this to get a higher quality version/wireframe etc.<br>
F3 to quikcly switch between wireframe and shading view. F4 to have both views at once.<br>
Middle mouse button to pan the view.<br>
Alt + Middle Mouse Button to orbit view.<br>
Scroll wheel to zoom.<br>
Ctrl + Alt + Middle Mouse Button + Mouse up/down for a slower zoom. <br>
Z centers object in viewport, similar to Maya's F.<br>
More camera navigation options in the bottom right.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Create objects from the right side menu.<br>
Objects have different orintation dependant on the viewport you create them in.<br>
Use autogrid option (above the objects in the object type menu) to orient your new object along the axis of a pre-existing one.<br>
On the modify object menu (next to the create object on the right), you can click the color box next to the object name and change the wireframe color.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Right click value spinners to set value to 0/lowest, good for zeoing out location.<br>
Saving is standard, no different file types like in maya.<br>
X,Y,Z coords of object at the bottom of the screen.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Select object button is square with the mouse over it in the top bar menu on the left.<br>
Hold Ctrl to select multiple objects at a time, and Alt to deselect.<br>
Window/Crossing (grey dashed box with blue cube) button on the topbar can be used to change slection mode, between all objects in rectangle and all objects entirely in recetangle.<br>
Selection sets (Middle of top bar) are a useful way of grouping objects just for selection.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Mostly the same as Maya.<br>
Angle snap button is corner with angle (lol) with magnet, right click to change angle amount. Shortcut is A.<br>
Hold down left click on scale tool button and select bottom option to get a squash and stretch scale.<br>
Bottom of the screen XYZ values change depending on what tool is in use.<br>
Recitile icon next to XYZ values can be clicked to add values to movement/scale etc without having to do the math yourself.<br>
Align tool is two bar graph looking thingy to the right of the create selection set object in the top toolbar. Works by selecting object to move then align to object.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Heirarchy command panel next to the object modify panel. Affect pivot only is the first option. You will then be able to move the pivot, and there are other pivot options in this menu.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Cooridnate system option is to the right of the scale tool, and determines which way the X,Y,Z axis face. Boxes at the bottom will always use world in absolute mode. Local is based on object orintation, useful for rotation.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Hold Shift and move/rotate/scale and object to clone it, and a dialogue box appears.<br>
In dialogue can specify multiple duplicates spaces evenly apart<br>
Different copy types: Copy is a copy, completely different object. Instance means they're the same object, changing one effects the other in modifiers, saves having to do minute changes multiple times.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
To add a modifier just go to the modifier tab and select one from the dropdown tab under the name.<br>
Similar to the maya modifiers but seemingly much better. Edit Poly seems to be like regular vertex editing in Maya.<br>
Taper: Flare one or both sides in or out<br>
Bend: Bend the object<br>
Edit Poly: Edit individual vertices/edges/faces as you would in Maya.<br>
Shell: Turn a regular faced object into a double sides one, like an empty box or pipe.<br>
Right click a modifier and click Collapse All to set all of these modifiers to permanent. <br>
Use mirror tool (Directly to the right of create selection set) to either mirror an object on its axis or duplicate it.<br>
Use merge option to import one scenes specific objects into another.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Can convert to poly with: Modelling -> Polygon Modeling -> convert to poly.<br>
Or right click -> convert to -> Convert to editable poly<br>
Or right click -> editable poly in modifier stack<br>
1 for vertex, 2 for edge, 3 for faces, 4 for the prior three, 5 for object<br>
Modeling tool window can take a second to appear<br>
Ctrl + Shift to duplicate drag when in editable poly mode, different from what's in the video.<br>
5 to switch between object and poly edit mode<br>
Clone to element keeps two polygons as the same object.<br>
Loop and ring in the modify selection window help you select edge loops and rings.<br>
Select edge then shift click on next edge to get ring of edges, double click on one edge for edge loop.<br>
Connect button connects all selected edges with an additional edge. CConnect settings also lets you add more edge loops in extra settings.<br>
Constrains in the modelling edit menu can be used so a vertex can only be moved along an edge/face/normal, super useful.<br>
Has a weild tool, weilds together all selected vertices.<br>
Target weild tool works similarly to the one you're used to in Maya, just click and drag one verticie onto another.<br>
Swift loop is insert edge loop from Maya almost exactly.<br>
Polygons should almost always have four sides, have smooth edge loops in grid pattern.<br>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
NURMS time. Smooths things out similar to Mayas smooth preview.<br>
Ctrl + double click a neighbouring face to select a face loop.<br>
Hold shift on switf loop tool to snap loop to center.<br>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Double click one edge of loop to select whole loop.<br>
Loop cylinder edge option hidden in loop settings.<br>
Group objects by clicking group then group from the top label menu.<br>
