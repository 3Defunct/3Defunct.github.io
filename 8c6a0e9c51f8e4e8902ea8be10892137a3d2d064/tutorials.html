<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>To change a viewport camera, use the associated letter with viewport selected, e.g. T for Top, P for Perspective.<br>
Another way to change camera type is to click the current view type, which shows a list of other options.<br>
Viewport layout tab in the bottom left.<br>
Right click the grey area between viewports to get reset layout option.<br>
Alt+W to maximise viewport.<br>
Shading viewport option next to current viewtype option, can use this to get a higher quality version/wireframe etc.<br>
F3 to uqikcly switch between wireframe and shading view. F4 to have both views at once.<br>
Middle mouse button to pan the view.<br>
Alt + Middle Mouse Button to orbit view.<br>
Scroll wheel to zoom.<br>
Ctrl + Alt + Middle Mouse Button + Mouse up/down for a slower zoom. <br>
Z centers object in viewport, similar to Maya's F.<br>
More camera navigation options in the bottom right.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Create objects from the right side menu.<br>
Objects have different orintation dependant on the viewport you create them in.<br>
Use autogrid option (above the objects in the object type menu) to orient your new object along the axis of a pre-existing one.<br>
On the modify object menu (next to the create object on the right), you can click the color box next to the object name and change the wireframe color.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Right click value spinners to set value to 0/lowest, good for zeoing out location.<br>
Saving is standard, no different file types like in maya.<br>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Select object button is square with the mouse over it in the top bar menu on the left.<br>
Hold Ctrl to select multiple objects at a time, and Alt to deselect.<br>
Window/Crossing (grey dashed box with blue cube) button on the topbar can be used to change slection mode, between all objects in rectangle and all objects entirely in recetangle.<br>
Selection sets (Middle of top bar) are a useful way of grouping objects just for selection.
